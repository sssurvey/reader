About Reader App:
Reader App is a third-party client for The Old Reader, which serves as the provider
 of news sources. Since The Old Reader offers an RSS service similar to Google Reader,
 users have full control over the content they subscribe to. Reader App does not promote,
 recommend, or curate any news—users decide which RSS feeds to follow. The app simply
 fetches and displays the RSS content from the subscriptions users have set up on The
 Old Reader website.

Developer & Purpose:
Reader App is developed and released by Haomin S. as a personal hobby project.
It is provided as a free application under the Google Play Store News category.

Privacy & Data Collection:
	• Reader App does not collect, store, or use any personal user data.
	• No logs or analytics are sent to the developer unless the user explicitly chooses to send feedback via email.
	• The app does not access or store The Old Reader account credentials beyond what is necessary for functionality. User credentials are stored locally on the device via Shared Preferences and are never transmitted elsewhere.

For any questions or concerns, please visit the GitHub repository and open an issue under the Issues page.
